# Telecom-Complaint-Preprocessing-and-Prediction
A machine learning project using real telecommunication data to classify customer complaints into two categories: internet or phone. The project focuses on data preprocessing and model building to predict the type of product based on complaint details.

_**Problem Statement**_
Telecommunication companies deal with thousands of customer complaints daily. Efficiently categorizing these complaints can help companies route them to the appropriate department for faster resolution. The objective is to predict whether the complaint is related to the “internet” or “phone” product.

_**Dataset**_
The dataset includes 10415 real customer complaint records with 26 features from a telecommunication company
 
_**Project Workflow**_
1.	Data Preprocessing
Preparing the data for modeling through handling missing values and encoding features 

2.	Modeling
Predicting the ‘Product’ through using 4 classification algorithms

3.	Visualizing the results
Comparing the performance of the 4 classification algorithms used through different charts and figures

_**Tech Stack**_
- Python: The main programming language used
- Pandas: for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn: for model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- Google Colab: The main tool used for coding and experimentation

_**How to Use**_
